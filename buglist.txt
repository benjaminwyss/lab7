isEmpty always returns true
addBack adds to the front of the list instead of the back
removeBack does not remove from the list and instead just returns false
removeFront does not remove from the list and instead just returns false
LinkedListOfInts' Destructor does not delete any pointers, so calling any number of addBacks or addFronts creates a memory leak
